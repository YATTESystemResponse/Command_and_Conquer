; ******* Notation *******

; Weapon Stage: 
; ? - Stage. 
; For weapons which have more than one stage, use this as a prefix for the stage number. 
; In case a projectile splits into more than one kind of cluster weapon, use the notation like this: 
; [OriginalWeapon]_[Stage][StageN]_[Weapon][WeaponN] and the same for projectile
; e.g.: 
; RainbowMissile_Stage2_2
; would denote the second cluster weapon of the second stage of the RainbowMissile

; Unit Level: 
; ? 
; L - Level. This describes the general experience level of the unit. Units generally become 'better' at what they do, the more experience they get. Ares employs a very simplified experience system, in which Exp is awarded for destroying units (like in any old-fashioned RPG), based on the destroyed unit's Cost. The experience is awarded completely to the unit landing the 'killshot', other units' contributions are not considered. Also, using an ability does not improve it - levels are only granted for experience points and per-unit, not per-ability or stat. 
; Beyond reflecting the general idea of improving one's technique through experience (ie learning), the Level could also refer to improved physical constitution from prolongued activity in the field (in biotic units). 

; Technology: 
; ? 
; T - TechLevel. In a way, this expresses the same as the Level above, only that it refers to the additional technique invested into making/improving the unit, rather than the additional expertise of the one operating it.
; Unlike Unit Level, it also hardly refers to buffed-up physical characteristics that go into making it. Tech/body response dilemma. 

; Upgrade: 
; U - Upgrade. Per-unit upgrade. 

; Gatting level
; G - 

; Simple Numeral
; A simple numerical suffix denotes one of a parallel group of weapons, i.e. weapons which are not conditionally related to levels or other factors. Simple Numeral weapons are rare and only occur for multi-weapon units which have multiple weapons of the same class, or for cluster weapons. 

; ******* Weapon Statistics *******
; The weapons specified here are attached to the various combat
; units and buildings.

; Anim = animation to display as a firing effect [use 8 for directional variation]
; AreaFire = indicates that the weapon fires at the current cell and does damage in a radius (def=no). Warning: This only works for secondary weapons right now.
; Bright = Does this weapons bullet cause a lighting effect when it impacts (def=no)? If set, this will override the warheads 'Bright' flag.
; Burst = number of rapid succession shots from this weapon (def=1)
; Camera = Reveals area around firer (def=no)?
; Charges = SJM: I have disabled this system.  Use IsAnimDelayedFire in ART.INI instead.  Does it have charge-up-before-firing logic (def=no)?
; Damage = the amount of damage (unattenuated) dealt with every bullet
; Floater = floats like a frizbee
; IonSensitive = Shuts down during an ion storm (def=no)?
; Lobber = does the projectile fly to target in a high arc (def=no)?
; MinimumRange = minimum range to target (def=0)
; Projectile = projectile characteristic to use
; RadLevel = the radiation level left by the weapon. (def=0)
; Range = maximum cell range
; ROF = delay between shots [15 = 1 second at middle speed setting]
; Report = List of sounds to random play when firing
; Speed = speed of projectile to target (100 is maximum)
; Supress = Should nearby friendly buildings be scanned for and if found, discourage firing on target (def=no)?
; TurboBoost = Should the weapon get a boosted speed bonus when firing upon aircraft?
; UseFireParticles = Should the weapon spawn a flame particle system? (def = no)
; Warhead = warhead to attach to projectile

;(Vulcan)	; This was a mad combination of the VulcanTower's fire rate and the Vulcan2's damage under the ID 'Vulcan' and was the weapon of the Sentry Gun in RA2/YR. It matches the Vulcan2 (which was easier to re-align from TS) stat-wise, with the only difference being the sound effect... I guess this makes it either the weapon of the Sentry Gun in NWO (after some stat adjustments, of course, and combining with VulcanTower, which is now SentryFletcher), or else it needs to be merged into the QuadCannon weapon, since that's the closest proxy for the Soviet sentry gun now!

; This _expressively_ only includes weapons that generate a direct fire stream (particle system), fire ball or simulated flame, not a projectile with incendiary warhead - those weapons are grouped by the characteristics of their projectile/launching system.

; Does not include bomb types; check dropped ordnance section up above for pyrogenic airbombs. 
; Does not include missile types with napalm warheads and the like, either.
