;*** Destroyer's 155mm Cannon *************************************************
;******************************************************************************
; This weapon is used on the Destroyer in RA2. 
; We're not really sure what caliber it is, but I've put it here since it uses the ID "155mm"... 
; It certainly has many stats that match those of the TS 155mm and is probably cloned/modified from it. 
; Still, it has many different characteristics in-game that make those matching stats (ARTYHE and Speed=10) odd, 
; and so they were changed.
